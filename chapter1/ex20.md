(define (gcd a b)
    (if (= b 0)
        a

)

for normal order evaluation
(gcd 206 40)
206 (gcd 40 6)
40 (gcd 6 4)
6 (gcd 4 2)
4 (gcd 2 0) - this would fail since gcd is not defined if one of the operands is 0

4 remainder operations

for applicative order evaluation
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 0)
2
