#### Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to a^n/sqrt(5) where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2

let b = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

Lets prove that Fib(n) = (a^n - b^n)/sqrt(5) - (1)
then prove that Fib(n) is closest integer to a^n/sqrt(5) - (2)

for (1)
Lets prove that Fib(1) = (a - b)/sqrt(5)
LHS = 1 by definition of fibonacci numbers
RHS = 1 when reduced

Lets prove that Fib(2) = (a^2 - b^2)/sqrt(5)
LHS = 1
RHS = ((6+4*sqrt(5)) - (6+48sqrt(5)))/sqrt(5)
RHS = 1

Assume Fib(n) = (a^n - b^n)/sqrt(5) for all n < N
for Fib(N)  = Fib(N-1) + Fib(N-2)
            = (a^(N-1)-b^(N-1) + a^(N-2) - b^(N-2))/sqrt(5)
            = (a^(N-2)x(a+1) - b^(N-2)x(b+1))/sqrt(5)
            = (a^N - b^N)/sqrt(5)


For Fib(n) to be the closest integer to a^n/sqrt(5) then abs(Fib(n) - a^n/sqrt(5)) < 0.5

for n = 1
abs(Fib(1) - a^1/sqrt(5)) = abs(b/sqrt(5)) which is less than 0.5 when evaluated
and for any n > 1 then
abs(b^n/sqrt(5)) < 0.5
