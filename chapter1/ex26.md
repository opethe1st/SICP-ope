```lisp
(define (expmod base exp m)
    (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
        (remainder  (*  (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                        (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                    )
                    m
        )
        )
        (else
        (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m))))
```

This is O(n) since the depth of the recursive calls in O(ln(n)) but the number of calls at each level is 2. So we have 2**ln(n) - which is 2.

This doesn't work like the version that uses square - because `(expmod base (/ exp 2) m)` is evaluated twice.
