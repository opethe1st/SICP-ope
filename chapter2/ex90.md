Too lazy so I am going to explain how to do this.

From the results of exercise 2.89, we know the only thing that needs to change when working with a different term-list representation are the
procedures that deal directly with it.
These procedures are
(adjoin-term term term-list)
(first-term term-list)
(add-terms)

these will install in a package for the dense and sparse representation

Polynomials will have two tags - 'polynomial and 'dense or 'sparse. It will look like

('polynomial 'dense ('x (list 1 2 1)))
('polynomial 'sparse ('x ((list 100 1) (list 0 1))))

so checked solutions online and just because I am not satisfied with them I just might do it.
The problem I see is that people don't reuse the stuff that was learned in earlier materials.
For example, this problem is a perfect analog to the rectangular/polar stuff and the solution I see still have so much duplication.

So trying to solve it and it's more work than I am willing to invest right now.
