Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances, there is a simple formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product
of two intervals in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify the problem by assuming that all numbers are positive.

Let interval1 be an interval with center1 and tolerance tolerance1.
This means that
the lower-bound is center1 - tolerance1*center1/100
the upper-bound is center1 + tolerance1*center1/100

Let interval2 be an interval with center2 and tolerance tolerance2.
This means that
the lower-bound is center2 - toleranc2e*center2/100
the upper-bound is center2 + tolerance2*center2/100

The product of intervals with positives bounds is
(make-interval
    (*
        (lower-bound x)
        (lower-bound y)
    )
    (*
        (upper-bound x)
        (upper-bound y)
    )
)
this translates to
lower-bound of the product ->
    (center1 - tolerance1*center1/100) `*` (center2 - tolerance2*center2/100)
    = center1*center2 -center1*center2*tolerance1/100 -center1*center2*tolerance2/100 + tolerance1*tolerance2*center1*center2/10000
    if we assume that tolerance1 and tolerance2 are small, then their product can be dropped
    = center1*center2 -center1*center2*tolerance1/100 -center1*center2*tolerance2/100
    = center1*center2(1 - (tolerance1/100+tolerance2/100))
via analogous reasoning the upper bound is
    = center1*center2(1 + (tolerance1/100+tolerance2/100))

which is equivalent to the interval with center = center1*center2 and tolerance = tolerance1+tolerance2
